	Abstract = {Fire activity has varied globally and continuously since the last
	glacial maximum (LGM) in response to long-term changes in global
	climate and shorter-term regional changes in climate, vegetation,
	and human land use. We have synthesized sedimentary charcoal records
	of biomass burning since the LGM and present global maps showing
	changes in fire activity for time slices during the past 21,000 years
	(as differences in charcoal accumulation values compared to pre-industrial).
	There is strong broad-scale coherence in fire activity after the
	LGM, but spatial heterogeneity in the signals increases thereafter.
	In North America, Europe and southern South America, charcoal records
	indicate less-than-present fire activity during the deglacial period,
	from 21,000 to ∼11,000 cal yr BP. In contrast, the tropical latitudes
	of South America and Africa show greater-than-present fire activity
	from ∼19,000 to ∼17,000 cal yr BP and most sites from Indochina and
	Australia show greater-than-present fire activity from 16,000 to
	∼13,000 cal yr BP. Many sites indicate greater-than-present or near-present
	activity during the Holocene with the exception of eastern North
	America and eastern Asia from 8,000 to ∼3,000 cal yr BP, Indonesia
	and Australia from 11,000 to 4,000 cal yr BP, and southern South
	America from 6,000 to 3,000 cal yr BP where fire activity was less
	than present. Regional coherence in the patterns of change in fire
	activity was evident throughout the post-glacial period. These complex
	patterns can largely be explained in terms of large-scale climate
	controls modulated by local changes in vegetation and fuel load.},

@article{Daniau2012,
	Abstract = {Climate is an important control on biomass burning, but the sensitivity
	of fire to changes in temperature and moisture balance has not been
	quantified. We analyze sedimentary charcoal records to show that
	the changes in fire regime over the past 21,000 yrs are predictable
	from changes in regional climates. Analyses of paleo- fire data show
	that fire increases monotonically with changes in temperature and
	peaks at intermediate moisture levels, and that temperature is quantitatively
	the most important driver of changes in biomass burning over the
	past 21,000 yrs. Given that a similar relationship between climate
	drivers and fire emerges from analyses of the interannual variability
	in biomass burning shown by remote-sensing observations of month-by-month
	burnt area between 1996 and 2008, our results signal a serious cause
	for concern in the face of continuing global warming.},

	volcanic eruptions and subsequent El Nino climate events(1,2). This
	connection, however, has remained controversial(3-5). Here we present
	support for a response of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
	phenomenon(6,7) to forcing from explosive volcanism by using two
	different palaeoclimate reconstructions of El Nino activity(8,9)
	and two independent, proxy-based chronologies of explosive volcanic
	activity(5) from AD 1649 to the present. We demonstrate a significant,
	multi-year, El Nino-like response to explosive tropical volcanic
	forcing over the past several centuries. The results imply roughly
	a doubling of the probability of an El Nino event occurring in the
	winter following a volcanic eruption. Our empirical findings shed
	light on how the tropical Pacific ocean-atmosphere system may respond
	to exogenous (both natural and anthropogenic) radiative forcing.},
